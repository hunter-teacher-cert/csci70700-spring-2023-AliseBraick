## Routes: 
- home (“/”)
- slips (“/slips”)
- picker (“/picker”)

# Flask_2
- I created a log in page. Username is: Alise and password is: Hello
_ if credentiuals are correct, the user will be directed to see the secret message through the route "/dashboard. I created an html (welcome.html) page to display the secret and the link to the home page and link to logout
- if credentials are not correct, the login page will be rendered again with a message " Incorrect credentials" and redirect the user again to login. 
- I added the # of visists to the home page and to the picker page

## I am not sure how to check if the session got deleted when the user log out. I pop out the session, but i still see the cookies when i log out. Please provide feedback about this feature. Thank you in advance
