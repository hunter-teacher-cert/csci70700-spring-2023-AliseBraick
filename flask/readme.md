## Routes: 
- home (“/”)
- slips (“/slips”)
- picker (“/picker”)

# Flask_2
- I created a log in page. Username is: Alise and password is: Hello
_ if credentiuals are correct, the user will be directed to see the secret message through the route "/dashboard. I created an html (welcome.html) page to display the secret and the link to the home page
- if credentials are not correct, the login page will be rendered again. I was not able to figure out how to display " Incorrect information" and redirect thge user aggain to login. I thought I can duplicate the login.html again andf display the message with the login. However, i think this is not an effiecient way. 
- I added the # of visists to the home page
