# Decryption Part 1

### I used the  brute force method to try all 25 shifts using a for loop
### I copied the message to code.org widget and find out that the shif of 17 works.

# Encryption Part 2

### I used the substituation method using random. Everytime we run the program we get a differnt random key. I also import the string module to count for punctuations, characters, digits, and upper and lower case letters, space was added as a string. I stored them in a list called chars()
### I made a copy of the char list and name it it key()
### I shuffled randomely the key() list
### I created a for loop to go through each letter/character of the plain_text(original) and find the index of each character/letter
### I looked at the same index in the key() list, the suffled one and find the letter/character that corresponds to this index
### for the Decryption, I reversred the process
### You can try the code by input any message
